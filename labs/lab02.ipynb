    "Perform a fake-data simulation as in Section 6.5, but using the flight school example on page 89. Simulate data from 500 pilots, each of whom performs two maneuvers, with each maneuver scored continuously on a 0–10 scale, that each pilot has a true ability that is unchanged during the two tasks, and that the score for each test is equal to this true ability plus independent errors. Further, suppose that when pilots score higher than 7 on the scale during the first maneuver they get praised, and that a score lower than 3 on the first maneuver result in negative reinforcement. Also suppose, though, that this feedback has no effect on performance on the second task.\n",

    "   (a) Make a scatterplot with one dot for each pilot, showing score on the second maneuver versus score on the first maneuver. Color the dots blue for the pilots who got praised, red for those who got negative reinforcement, and black for the other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (b) Compute the average change in scores for each group of pilots. If you did your simulation correctly,the pilots who were praised did worse, on average, and the pilots who got negative reinforcement improved, on average, for the second maneuver. Explain how this happened, given that your data were simulated under a model in which the positive and negative messages had no effects."
