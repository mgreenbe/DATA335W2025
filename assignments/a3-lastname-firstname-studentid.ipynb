    "***To do:*** Use Bambi to fit a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model with home-field advantage to the 2024 CFL data, with priors as described above. Compare the resulting posterior means and standard errors to the coefficient and standard error estimates obtained from a fit using `statsmodels`. If they're quite different, then our priors might not be well-calibrated and are exerting too strong an influence. Increase the uncertainty in the prior distributions and fit the Bambi model again.\n",
